    IFO_START_SCREEN_FLEET_OVERLORDS:1000 " \nAdmiral's Log: §H2200.01.01§!\n\n§LWe've been struggling for this for too long. Several decades had been spent to gather the Fleet and unify all of us under the single banner. Too long we're living inside the legions of iron flying through the cold space. Too long to miss a threat, somewhere outside our views. All that we've built, was lost at once.\n\nWe are not alone anymore.\n\nOthers still don't know what happened. We have to rebuild our Federation Fleet as soon as we could before they notice its absence. Our species must be protected again!"
