At the beginning we were similar to any other hive mind you could find in this galaxy. However, as we started to colonize other systems, we discovered that our home system was, is, unique. Unique because the Shroud is closer to the physical realm than in any other place of this galaxy. After some experiments and some huge efforts, we moved our planet to where the borders separating our realms are the thinnest. Namely between the three stars.\nWe then slowly stopped any operation we had beyond this system to fully focus on our newly found link to the Shroud. The §YKellectors§! hit us at that time by abducting some queens that were on their way back."

They pretend to want to protect the biological species of the galaxy from extinction. While this goal may seem very noble at first sight, what they instead do is abduct members of every species, lock them up in their shielded worlds and conduct every type of experiment they want on them while making sure to keep a stable amount of subject by preventing them suicide.\nWe thought that they wouldn't target us as all of our queens are linked to each other via the Shroud. But they did. And since then, we've been experiencing what our captured queens go through everyday. Mainly experiments to understand the nature of psionicity and of the Shroud. Hopeless experiments as robots will never understand it.\nWe tried to rescue our queens but until now the defenses of the Kellectors were too strong."

It was their children that we have to thank for being finally activated, although it was more of an accident given how their mental faculties were lowered compared to their ancestors.\nWe lived here and there, accumulating experiences and knowledge. After seing so many biological species go extinct, we decided to save them from extinction by harboring some members of every species of this galaxy inside our shielded world."
    paradigm_shift.101.question.system:1000 "Did you build this system?"
    paradigm_shift.101.answer.system:1000 "As you've guessed, this system is almost entirely artificial. Only the star is the same as before. We had to transport gigantic amounts of matter to form the different planets.\nThe molten planets house most of our processing power used for the administration of the shielded world. Housing several millions of different species would be a near impossible task without it. The gas giants are used to produce the food our guests need and the black holes are powering up our defenses.\nThis design has been quite effective. The main flaw we discerned is that the shielding of our planets doesn't seem to be able to cut the connection to the Shroud of the §YZaxoid§! despite our best efforts. At least our defenses are strong enough to repel them."

They retired themselves to their systems millenias ago but me managed to get some of their queens and put them in security in one of our shielded world. However, the shielding didn't cut their connection to the hive mind. They've been trying since then to overpower our defenses to \"free\" the queens we saved."
